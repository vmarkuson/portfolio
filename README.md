Running Instructions

1. First, create a directory where you will store your website files.

2. Create an index.html file and add your HTML code to it. Be sure to include all necessary tags such as <html>, <head>, <body>, etc. and to link any CSS and JavaScript files as needed.

3. Save your index.html file in the directory you created in step 1.

4. Open your web browser and navigate to the file path of your index.html file. For example, if your index.html file is located in a directory named "my_website" on your desktop, you can open it by typing "file:///Users/your_username/Desktop/my_website/index.html" in your browser's address bar.

5. Your website should now be displayed in the browser. You can continue to make changes to your index.html file and refresh the page in your browser to see the updates.

### Project Outcome
This project allows me to update my website template as I learn new skills, gain work experience, and update my personal information. With this project, I have a specific website where recruiters and colleagues can view my projects, social media profiles, and contact information.
